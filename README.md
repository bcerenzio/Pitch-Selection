### Collaborators: Brett Cerenzio, Aidan Gurvitch, Danielle Napierski, Zach Silverstein, Dylan Stafeil

Evaluated swing decisions Of batters throughout the 2021-2024 season based on pitch-by-pitch characteristics (Velo, Movement, Sequencing, etc.). We then found the Swing Probability, Contact Probability, & xDamage (xwOBACON) of each pitch to evaluate if the batter made the correct decision. We combined the 3 measures and put the final metric on a 20-80 scale to evaluate who made the best decisions at the plate.
